    <b><h1>How to bake a Cake!</h1></b>
    <br>
    Based on the Hungarian Dobos torte (pronounced Do-bash), this cake was  developed in New Orleans, Lousisana by a local baker, Beulah Ledner in 1933. This cake is made of multiple layers of cake alternating with pudding. Locals serve up this rich cake for birthdays, anniversaries, Mardi Gras and any other special occasion.This cake doesnâ€™t require any complex or rare ingredients, but it does take up a lot of time.

        <h2><b>Personal Opinions:</b></h2>
        <h3>Scratch or store-bought </h3>
        
        I think baking from scratch is much better so you clearly know all the measurements, you can also make the cake to your own preferance, and taste.
